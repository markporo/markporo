👋 My name is Mark! I enjoy building fun projects with code, writing music, skateboarding, and drinking highly caffeinated drinks.

For the last decade most of my work has been centered around music --touring, writing, recording, teaching. These past several years, however, I have developed a passion for learning and writing code. Through various Udemy courses and other online resources, I first studied web development on my own. Currently, however, I am enrolled at Bloom University of Technology where I have decided to enhance my skills so that I can further launch into a career in tech.

## About Me

---

👨🏻 I’m currently learning Applied Computer Science at BloomTech

💪🏻 Outside of BloomTech, I am going through another Udemy course called "The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp" for education reinforcement.

🤘🏻I really enjoy the designing aspect of building sites. CSS is such an important asset to the user's experience and I hope that I can find work that allows me to really dig into the styling along with the functionality of a web app.

👊🏻 Fun fact: I have run 2 marathons and hundreds of 5ks and 8ks in my life.

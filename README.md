## Mark Porostosky Jr.

👋 My name is Mark! I enjoy building fun projects with code, writing music, and drinking highly caffeinated drinks.

For the last decade most of my work has been centered around music --touring, writing, recording, teaching. These past several years, however, I have developed a passion for web development. Through various Udemy courses and other online resources, I first studied web development on my own.  I then enrolled and graduated from Bloom University of Technology to further my skills.  I was employed by a company called Cro Metrics for about 8 months until the economic down turn forced a lay off.  I'm currently looking for work and getting back to some personal projects in the mean time. 

## About Me

---

👨🏻 Graduated in 2022 from Bloom Instutute of Technology to focus on programming for web, but also have a bachelors from Mount Vernon Nazarene University. 

💪🏻 I live in Cleveland, Ohio.  

🤘🏻I really enjoy the designing aspect of building sites. CSS is such an important asset to the user's experience and I hope that I can find work that allows me to really dig into the styling along with the functionality of a web app.

👊🏻 Fun fact: I have run 2 marathons and hundreds of 5ks and 8ks in my life.
